# ParkAway
SI Messaging Project

## Instructions for running the project
Run rabbit mq, either locally or on container.

Run both node applications in separate consoles with `node start app.js` and `node start server.js`

Use postman to make requests to the client application, and you can use rabbit mq management to monitor the queues.
